# FAQ - Security, Privacy and Compliance

## Checkly
Checkly is the API & E2E monitoring platform for developers. Checkly monitors the correctness, performance, and uptime of APIs and web applications via synthetic monitoring mechanisms.

Being a Software as a Service, it operates as an external agent from the public internet with no need for installation within or privileged access to the user's network.

Checkly can run two types of monitoring checks:

1. API checks, which consist of one or more HTTP requests to a user-defined API endpoint
2. Browser checks, which run a series of user-defined interactions on a web page through a headless browser.

Data such as response logs, timings, screenshots, and other similar artifacts are then processed and displayed on Checkly.

In short, Checkly:

- Simulates browser click flows and API requests like a real end-user or connected services.
- Has no access to the monitored application's source code.
- Only mock or test data should be used to run the tests.

## Security Response
We operate a white hat program that encourages developers to investigate and collaborate with Checkly on security vulnerabilities. Please find more here: https://www.checklyhq.com/security/security-response/.
