#### Syntax Highlighting

```js
export default {
  name: 'DocsInfo',
  props: {
    content: {
      type: String,
      default: ''
    }
  }
}
```

#### Jargon

Then something, something, _recursion_ on _deployment_.

## Getting started: monitoring & alerting

Start with monitoring your key webapp flows, your backend API's and set up alerting, so you get a notification when things
break or slow down.
