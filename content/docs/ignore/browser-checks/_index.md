This quick start should give you all the info to create your first browser check with Checkly. You should have some prior
knowledge working with Javascript and/or Node.js.

## What is a browser check?

The five lines of code below are already a valid browser check. Its usefulness might be not that great, but still...

{{< tabs "Basic example" >}}
{{< tab "Puppeteer" >}}
 ```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')
const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()
await page.goto('https://checklyhq.com/')
await browser.close()
 ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Playwright" >}}
 ```js
const playwright = require('playwright')
const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()
await page.goto('https://checklyhq.com/')
await browser.close()
 ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

In essence, a browser check is a Node.js script that starts up a Chrome browser, loads a web page and interacts with that web page.
The script validates assumptions you have about that web page, for instance:

- Is my shopping cart visible?
- Can users add products to the shopping cart?
- Can users log in to my app?

Checkly uses the **[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)** and
**[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)** frameworks to drive these actions.
Puppeteer and Playwright are Javascript frameworks that "talk" to a real Google Chrome browser.
You use the both frameworks to control the interactions you want to happen on a web page.

Checkly currently supports using only **Google Chrome** with both Puppeteer and Playwright

## Breaking down a browser check step-by-step

Let's look at a more real life example and break down each step. The code below logs into Checkly, waits for the dashboard
to fully load and then snaps a screenshot.

{{< tabs "Breakdown example" >}}
{{< tab "Puppeteer" >}}
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer') // 1
const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()

await page.goto('https://app.checklyhq.com/login') // 2

await page.type('input[type="email"]', 'john@example.com') // 3
await page.type('input[type="password"]','mypassword')
await page.click('.btn.btn-success.btn-block')

await page.waitForSelector('.status-table') // 4
await page.screenshot({ path: 'checkly_dashboard.png' })
await browser.close()
```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Playwright" >}}
```js
const playwright = require('playwright') // 1
const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()

await page.goto('https://app.checklyhq.com/login') // 2

await page.type('input[type="email"]', 'john@example.com') // 3
await page.type('input[type="password"]','mypassword')
await page.click('.btn.btn-success.btn-block')

await page.waitForSelector('.status-table') // 4
await page.screenshot({ path: 'checkly_dashboard.png' })
await browser.close()
 ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

**1. Initial declarations:** We first import a framework (Puppeteer or Playwright) to control a browser.
We also declare a “browser” and a “page” variable.

**2. Initial navigation:** We use the `page.goto()` method to load the first page.

**3. Fill out input fields and submit:** Using the `page.type()` and `page.click()` methods we enter our email address and
password and click the login button. You would normally use environment variables here to keep sensitive data
out of your scripts. See [Login scenarios and secrets](/docs/browser-checks/login-and-secrets/) for more info.

**4. Wait for dashboard and close:** The expected behaviour is that the dashboard loads. In our case we can recognise this
by the correct loading of the `.status-table` element in the page. For a visual reference, we also take a screenshot.
We then close the browser. Our check is done.

## How do I create a browser check?

Every valid **[Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer)**
or **[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright)** script is a valid browser check. You can create these
scripts in two ways:

1. By using [Headless Recorder](/headless-recorder/) (our Chrome browser extension) to record a set of actions and
generate the Puppeteer or Playwright script automatically.
2. By writing the Node.js by hand.

A combination of both is also very common, i.e. you record the basic interactions with Headless Recorder and then tweak
the generated code with extra things like passwords, extra wait conditions and content checks.

In both cases, you can always **run and debug the script on your local machine** and tweak it to perfection before
uploading it
to Checkly.


{{< info >}}
Every valid Puppeteer or Playwright script is a valid browser check. If the script passes, your check passes.
If the script fails, your check fails.

## How do I assert assumptions?

Navigating around your app or site can already give you a lot of confidence your critical business processes are working correctly.
However, many times you want to assert specific values on a page.

- After login, you want the user name to be displayed.
- On a dashboard, you want certain panels to be visible and filled with data.
- Submitting a form should return a specific value.

To do this, you can:

1. Use [Node's built in `assert`](https://nodejs.org/api/assert.html) function.
2. Use the popular [Chai.js](https://www.chaijs.com/) library of TDD and BDD assertions.

You can use as many assertions in your code as you want. For example, in the code below we scrape the text from the
large button on the Checkly homepage and assert it in two ways.


{{< tabs "Assertions example" >}}
{{< tab "Puppeteer" >}}
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer')
const assert = require('assert')
const expect = require('chai').expect

const browser = await puppeteer.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()
await page.goto('https://checklyhq.com/')

// get the text of the button
const buttonText = await page.$eval('a.btn-lg', el => el.innerText)

// assert using built-in assert function
assert.equal(buttonText, 'Start your free trial')
// assert using Chai's expect function
expect(buttonText).to.equal('Start your free trial')

await browser.close()
 ```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Playwright" >}}
```js
const playwright = require('playwright')
const assert = require('assert')
const expect = require('chai').expect

const browser = await playwright.chromium.launch()
const page = await browser.newPage()
await page.goto('https://checklyhq.com/')

// get the text of the button
const buttonText = await page.$eval('a.btn-lg', el => el.innerText)

// assert using built-in assert function
assert.equal(buttonText, 'Start your free trial')
// assert using Chai's expect function
expect(buttonText).to.equal('Start your free trial')

await browser.close()
 ```
{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}

Note the following:

- We use the `page.$eval()` method to grab the button element and get its innerText property.
- We use a basic `assert` and a Chai.js `expect` statement to verify the text is correct.

When an assertion fails, your check fails. Your check's result will show the log output for the error. Any configured
alerting channels will be triggered, notifying your team that something is up.
