We created Headless Recorder (formerly know as Puppeteer Recorder) as a cool Sunday afternoon side project while working on Checkly. The project is now at 
20k+ users and 10K GitHub stars! Things were a little quiet around the project, but that's going to change. 

Checkly is growing and we want to double down on making Headless Recorder the most awesome 100% open source E2E test 
recorder on the planet. To be 100% transparent, we want to do this because:

1. It is good for unsucking E2E test creation in general.
2. It is therefore good for Checkly users.

## Survey results

We ran a [survey]((https://surveys.hotjar.com/s?siteId=717179&surveyId=137462)) among Headless Recorder users the last months. 
We got ~400 responses. Here are the annotated results.

## Roadmap (work in progress)

Based on our own findings at Checkly and the survey results, we are going to start working on a new version of Headless Recorder.
As always, we cannot give any hard promises on dates or features, but this is an initial sketch of what we want to achieve.

- Support Puppeteer & Playwright.
- Support Jest and Mocha test creation with assertions.
- Record and playback in the browser.
- In-screen helpers for targeting the right selectors.
- Handling of authentication scenarios.
- Export to file or 3rd party service.
