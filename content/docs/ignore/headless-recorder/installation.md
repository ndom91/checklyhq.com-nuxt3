## Setup for Checkly

By default, Headless Recorder generates code that is wrapped in an `async` helper function. This is handy when you want
to save the generated code directly to a file on your local machine and run the code with a simple `node myscript.js`.

However, Checkly already wraps your code when running browser checks. You therefore need to uncheck the option **wrap code in 
async function**. After this, all code generated by Headless Recorder can be directly copy & pasted into Checkly.

## Options

Open the options tab by clicking the cogwheel icon. In this tab you will find a set of configuration options that impact
how Headless Recorder generates Puppeteer and Playwright code. Most options are self explanatory, but two very important ones are:

- **add waitForNavigation lines on navigation**: this determines if extra statements are added to wait for browser reloads
when navigating from page to page. Turning this options off can result in failing or hanging scripts.
- **add waitForSelector lines before every page.click()**: Setting this option generates a `waitForSelector` statement before
each `page.click()` statement, effectively always guarding for clicking on elements that are not (yet) available on a page.

It is recommended to leave both options checked in all cases.
