If you are using Vercel to develop, preview, and ship your application have two options:

1. Directly integrate with Vercel by [installing the Checkly integration from the Vercel Marketplace](https://vercel.com/integrations/checkly) and following the easy install wizard.
2. Leverage Checkly's [GitHub Deployments integration](/docs/cicd/github/)

> You can also use Checkly together with Vercel's [password-protected deployments](/docs/browser-checks/login-scenarios#password-protected-websites).
