The browser checks Puppeteer engine has been upgraded to Puppeteer version 1.7.0. This new version brings some minor
changes to mostly the `puppeteer.launch()` method and some default properties. Noteworthy is the that you can type
emoji's with `page.type()` , i.e.

```javascript
await page.type("input.my-input", "I ‚ù§Ô∏è turtles üê¢");
```
