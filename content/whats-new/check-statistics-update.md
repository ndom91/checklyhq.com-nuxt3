We made a couple of tweaks to the Check statistics page based on customer feedback and to address some performance issues.

1. We now show the **24 hour**, **7 day** and **30 day** success ratio KPI's to give a better short term / long term view on the
health of your checks.

2. We've add the **99 percentile response time** to the per location response times chart to give you a better view on how response
time are distributed for a specific data center location.

Under the hood, we tweaked query performance and aggregation performance which results in a 70% performance gain.
