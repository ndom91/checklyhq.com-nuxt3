You can now invite team members to your Checkly account and collaborate on your API and browser checks.
Inviting a team member is as easy as sending them an invite from the **users** tab in your account settings.
We've also added full **role based access control**. This means you can assign, change and revoke admin, read & write or
read only rights to any user.

The starter account already includes five team members. See our updated [plans & pricing page](/pricing/) for more info on
pricing or read more about how inviting and managing team members work in [our docs section](/docs/teams/adding-team-members/).
