<h2 class="text-center section-header mb-4">Why Checkly and not Assertible?</h2>

Checkly is built for developers and engineering teams eager to monitor their cloud native applications.

    body="Assertible is great when you want to know if your APIs are up. But it doesn't show you the full picture - whether your UI flows and endpoints are working correctly."
